There are 2 packages under src - Main and test.  
Main has 2 sub packages - Resources (which contains base page and data file) and pageobjects (Pageobjects will have 5 pages with objcets related to 5 TC java classes).  
Test will have 5 test cases(java class files) belonging to 5 products.  
I have created 1 product page object file under Pageobjects package and 1 Test case file for the same product U.S. Dollar TD Community / Not-for-Profit Plans.
Task is to have 4 more products object file under resources>pageobjects and 4 more test case files under Test package.
